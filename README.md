# Snake-game

## About:
A small snake game I made in Python for fun (in under 4 hours).

## Requirements:

* Python (version  3.0 or above)
* [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

## Demo:
### Mid-game explanation:

Game displays you (red snake), the food (white square) and the score at the top-right.

* The "score" is the current score, 
* "max" is the highest score made during play.
* Player loses when snake touches its red body, and the game will reset the score back to 0.
