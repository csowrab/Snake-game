# Snake-game

## About:
A small snake game I made in Python for fun (in under 4 hours).

## Demo:
### Mid-game explanation:

Game displays you (red snake), the food (white square) and the score at the top-right.

The "score" is the current score, "max" is the highest score made during play.
Player loses when snake touches its red body, and the game will reset the score back to 0.
